Diglossia is hard. A dearth of resources for learning lived forms of Arabic points to the complexities of a language that deserves more names than it is typically given. This project seeks to build a repository of public resources between Tunisian and English. We imagine a community ultimately taking shape around and contributing to a set of bidirectional and up-to-date tools for language acquisition and maintenance. The first step we're taking is to create an updated dictionary from one compiled by Rached Ben Abdelkader, published by the Peace Corps in 1977. Our task is to extract and store each entry in a simple but ductile data structure that will prove generative for future tools and reference works.
